FIRST CREATE YOUR OWN APPLICATION AND BOT ON DISCORD DEVELOPER PORTAL: https://discord.com/developers/applications

THEN OPEN REPLIT OR YOU CAN USE ANY CODE EDITOR THAT YOU WANT: https://replit.com/~

CREATE A FILE MAIN.PY AND KEEP_ALIVE.PY AND COPY THE CODE INSIDE THE FILE

GO TO OPENAI: https://openai.com/

CLICK THE API BUTTON ABOVE AND LOOK FOR SOME SAMPLES FOR THIS ONE I USED THE MARVIC SARCASTIC APPLICATION THEN COPY THE CODE.

MAKE SURE TO CREATE YOUR OWN API BY MAKING A FREE ACCOUNT ON OPENAI.

THAT SHOULD BE WORKING NOW
